A. When creating console applications on the Linux platform I should add a few new-line characters after a menu display.
The reason for this is so that the user can view the current menu displayed as well as the user can also view what they are
typing in for that current selection.

    5. Quit.
    
    Enter in a selection:
    
    >>> The second or third time the menu displays we can only see up until option 3
        on line 20 we also can not see what we are typing in.

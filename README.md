# LinuxParrotOS64Debian
This is a repository of projects done using Linux. We will be using Oracle Virtual Box and the **Linux Parrot 64 bit OS Debian**. <br><br>
[ Parrot 64 bit Debian ISO ]: (https://www.parrotsec.org/) <br> [ Oracle Virtual Box ]: (https://www.virtualbox.org/)
<br><br>
**Make sure that you check to see if we have a valid ISO file after downloading to ensure that the file was not tampered with using the command (Windows) `certutil -hashfile Parrot-home-4.10_amd64.iso SHA256`**

<br><br>
If you need help with any of the configuration steps dont be afraid to email: <a href="mailto:bmxfiend1@gmail.com">bmxfiend1@gmail.com</a>
<br><br>
Data to keep track of:
  1. Root password.
  2. Account name.
  3. Account password.
<br><br>
If you forget your **password** you can simply restart the Virtual machine and boot in "Recovery mode" once the terminal has loaded you will be required to enter in your *Root Password*. The command to change the password for the associated account
is `sudo passwd username` The *Username* is likely to be your name in lowercase.
<br><br>
**Aside from all of this the repository will contain programs that relate to developing on the Linux platform.**
